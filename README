This project aims at implementing a generic, user-friendly parser able to deal with any kind of grammar and manage read/write facilities. For instance, it should be possible to parse a string representation (e.g. XML tree), access some of its values in a domain-relevant way (e.g. Node getRoot(), Collection<Node> getChildren()), change these values in a domain-relevant way (e.g. setRoot(Node root), addChild(Node child)) and retrieve the corresponding string representation (e.g. XML tree) with the new values. Thus, such a parser should be extensible to any domain and provide a user-friendly bridge between the file parsed and the domain logics.
